Under a sky split between night and dawn, Maya wandered through an abandoned city, her only companion a stray dog she named Orion. 
Shadows painted the empty streets, and buildings stood like forgotten giants. 
She wasn’t alone by chance—she was searching for her family, lost to the last storm that swept the city. 
Just as she neared the towering ruins of an old library, Orion barked, sensing movement. 
A light flickered in a shattered window. Holding her breath, Maya crept closer, hopeful and wary. 
Maybe, this time, she’d find not just traces of the past but a path forward.
